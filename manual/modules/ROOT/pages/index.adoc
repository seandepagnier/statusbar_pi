== 1. What and Why

=== What can StatusBar do?

Shows Dashboard and Nmea Data at the bottom of the screen in various formats.

=== Why is StatusBar useful?

Informs the skipper of conditions that are useful in navigation.
StatusBar plugin replaces builtin statusbar. The builtin status bar
(disable from the User Interface tab) can be very difficult to read.

The statusbar plugin improves on some of these difficulties. It is best
used with OpenGL enabled (requires some basic OpenGL extensions).

== 2. Installation

Statusbar is available as a managed plugin. The OpenCPN Manual has general information in xref:opencpn-plugins:misc:plugin-install.adoc[Plugin Download, Install and Enable] 
for installing this plugin. This is the preferred way.

In OpenCPN, go to the _Options → Plugins_ and download, install and enable the sQuiddio plugin (no settings are required).

. In OpenCPN  Click *Tools-Options-Plugins*
. First "Update" the master plugins catalog.
. Select the Statusbar entry and "Install" the plugin.
. In the list of installed plugins "Enable" the sQuiddio plugin and "Apply".
. Use “*Preferences*” to set your preferences (should be self-explanatory). Then “*Apply*.
. After successful installation, the plugin should be available in the plugins tab of your OpenCPN options dialog box.
. Then close *Options* and the data should appear at the bottom of the screen.

=== How to disable the OpenCPN lower Status bar.

. Settings > User Interface.
. Uncheck “Show Status Bar”.
